# Foundations of CS 
 
The application I made is very simple and user-friendly. When you run the application, you get a welcome message and two other important messages in the terminal. The first message includes both the private and public keys, which are randomly generated by the application. The second message allows you to choose whether to encrypt, decrypt, or exit the application. When decrypting it asks for the message in numbers you’d like to encrypt. After doing so, it gives you the encrypted message (C1,C2). When selecting decrypt, it asks you for the encrypted message then it gives you the decrypted message. When you’re done you select exit.
